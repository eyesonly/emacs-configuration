This is the real deal - a site that allows you to keep a record of all of the birthdays that are important to you. For free. And your personal data is never locked away from you.

Birthdays

Free

The business model behind this site is not to charge users for it. So no annoying monthly payment. This site is intended to be supported by advertising. So, please be nice and don't hide the advert bars (and if you did click on adverts that interested you too, that would be very kind!)

Reminder emails, for free.

BirthdayJuggler can automatically send "Happy Birthday" emails to your friends. And a reminder to yourself as well. And you decide when these mails get sent - for important friends you might want a reminder email a few more days in advance.


No data lock-in

Your personal data is never locked away from you. So once you've entered all the birthdays of all the people that are important to you once, you should never have to do it again. This site can provide you with backups of all the data you enter. You choose what format you'd like it in - a word document? Synchronize with google calendar? No problem.
