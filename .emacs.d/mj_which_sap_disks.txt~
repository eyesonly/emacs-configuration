Hi

I'm wasting some time this morning looking at *starting* to install an
XI service. I've separated the disks that I inherited into different 'stacks' and am
trying to make sense of the different groupings:

(1) The most interesting are a pile in slim cases labeled
ERP2005. Putting the first one in I see that it is Live Cache SPS07


I have ignored the CRM, XI 2.0 (20021030), 4.5B (full set) disks, but
if I've missed something that should be here, please let me know.
