Hmmmm... faith? A question to ask to the faithless?

I'm going to assume you mean belief in God here on this one.

"If religion isn't the greatest threat to rationality and scientific progress, what is?" asks Daniel Dennett in a recent article in The Guardian. I tend to agree with this one here, being of the opinion that blind faith in God, and the requirement that blind faith exist as a testament in order to be regarded as devout is a *bad thing*.

I hope I'm not going out on a limb here and offending your religious beliefs, but I'm not going to lie here. I think that either one does or does not believe, and a good argument isn't going to change my inner 'gut' belief.

Now, on the other hand I come from a highly traditional Jewish family. My one brother is a Rabbi, and both my other brother and mom keep the Sabbath and the other 612 commandments in the full orthodox tradition. It just doesn't tie in with my world view, and when there was a swing to fundamentalism in the early 90s I didn't follow along with my family. There is plenty of space in the Jewish world for being a non-believer actually. I like to think that I fit in with a long line of Jewish non believers, including Einstein, Freud, Feynman. Of course, there is an implication here, and that implication boils down to how much of this to impart on the pliable young minds of my children!

Shira (my wife, in case you haven't guessed yet) has a completely different world view here, she really wants to know about real TRUTH, and at one stage even explored a Christian cult (the church of christ). She believes in God. When it came to choosing a nursery school for Cailin, it was interesting - there are no secular nursery schools in our area - so Cailin goes to the local Jewish nursery school. I find it unsettling that she believes unstintingly in God, and says her prayers before bedtime, just as I did when I was six years old.
